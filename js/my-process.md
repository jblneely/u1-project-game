**Technologies used:

>>javascript, jqery, css, html

**Your process/approach:

>whiteboard on paper and .txt file.  I was most concerned about the java script.  I spent a lot of time getting the dice to work, thinking about how to get it to return pairs and sort the highest winning pair, and finally working on a "switch" for a random 'eightball style' answer function.  I preserved some of those thoughts in a separate file, "SumGame.js".  Once I was satisfied with my function for random number generation (math.random to a max of 6) and sorting the highscore, I began working on the styling.  Reno created the dice face images for me using his Adobe Illustrator.  We then changed the id names to link the dice face to the number generated. .... then I rolled the dice to make design decisions the rest of the site(just kidding).

I used jquery to .hide and .show elements.  I learned that when hiding or unhiding an <a> element you need to use the "event.preventDisable" function to avoid it reloading the page.

**Installation instructions.

?This is a really simple game, but its simplicity has let to its longevity.  The excitement is provided by the participants.

**Unsolved problems.

>the function to return "of-a-kind".  

**Your biggest wins and challenges.

>Challenges:  I draft something, but forget a capital case and it doesn't work, and I spend a lot of time trying to rebuild it.  Looking on the various resources, MDN, w3c, Stackoverflow, etc. format changes make it look like there is different syntax.  Being new to JQ and JS, it is difficult to keep the syntax straight.

>Wins: happy with the look and function.

---------------------------
what I would do if I had one more week:

1.  autofill the winner name in the output.
2.  add a camera icon saves the content of the bet, or takes an image of the subject matter.
3.  add quasi binding language with click agreement.  I agree to be bound by the terms set forth above...
4. 	create an autopopulate database of roll results with others.  opt-in or not.
5.  get the sound working!
6.  get the footer not to float on unhide.
